            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that re-entry transitioning must begin during incarceration and continue post-release
                with the end result of gainful employment. Our programs are designed so that
                participants develop highly marketable personal and 
                professional skills that are relevant and competitive in today's business environment.
                We also prepare individuals with criminal records for the process of introducing themselves to potential employers and teaches them how to market themselves, with a focus on personal branding.

            <h2>Reentry to the workforce</h2>
            <p>
                Through hiring, community, and government partners, The Saving Grace Industries aims to help turn the technology and business skills learned while incarcerated into careers. The Saving Grace Industries workforce re-entry program accelerates opportunities for Returned Citizens to find jobs in tech and business. In partnership with a top tier tech companies, SGI Returned Citizens continue their education and build upon their skills through paid apprenticeships while also shifting perceptions around formerly incarcerated individuals.
                Through Next Chapter, our partnership with Slack, The Kellogg Foundation and FreeAmerica, we are building a year-long apprenticeship program to train and mentor graduates from The Saving Grace Industries â€” and in doing so, we hope to create a blueprint that other companies will use to train and hire talented people who have been incarcerated.

            <h2>Family support</h2>
            <p>
                We stabilize families by connecting them with the resources they need to thrive. From food, furniture, and household supplies to summer learning opportunities and family reunification assistance, we meet our families where they are. In-house support is also offered through our Summer Lunch Program and Caregiver Support Group. Intake appointments are scheduled with each of our client families to determine how we can be of the most support.
                We support children who have experienced the incarceration or deportation of a parent or loved one through school-based and afterschool support groups. Hosted during the school day in partnership with participating CMS schools or after school in partnership with Newell Presbyterian Church, SGI provides children with a safe place to build character, develop coping skills, improve academic readiness, and find encouragement.
